CF-Labs
=======
CF-Labs is my personal ColdFusion Playground. Since my Development Box has ColdFusion 10 on it,
some of these Experiements may *or may not* Work on Previous Versions of ColdFusion.


I will Attempt to Use the Following Conventions:


CF10-FileName = Needs to Run on ColdFusion 10

CF09-Filename = Needs to Run on ColdFusion 9

CF-Filename = *Should be* ColdFusion Independant


Each Project Listed within My CF-Labs Repo, contains it's own individual README.md
