CF10-WSChat
=======
CF10-WSChat is an experiment in ColdFusion 10 Websockets.


It it a fully running Application, and it saves Messages sent via the Socket to a Database (MySQL or SQL Server), using
$.ajax() from within the submitMessage Socket Command.

The UI is Twitter Bootstrap. 


The Database Table Scripts are included in the assets/install Folder.

Enjoy Playing with it.

If you have better methods for getting the data into the Database, PLEASE Share.
